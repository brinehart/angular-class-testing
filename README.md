# Angular Class Testing

This is a basic app that can help teach how to test various types of units in an Angular app. We go over testing component initialization, public methods, event handling, asynchronous methods including Observables, and synchronous methods.

## Packages Used
Jasmine Auto Spy - Easy and type safe way to write spies for jasmine tests, for both sync and async (promises, Observables) returning methods.

Observer Spy - An easy to understand, un-complex way to test complex observables

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
